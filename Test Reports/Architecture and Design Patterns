Architectures:
  Service Oriented- This architecture would work well for our project as our project fits within to the 
                    four properties of Service Oriented Architecture. 
                    Namely :It logically represents a business activity with a specified outcome.
                            It is self-contained.
                            It is a black box for its consumers.
                            It may consist of other underlying services.
                            
                    Based on these properties it is easy to see how the services for our project are provided to other 
                    components. A service is a discrete unit of functionality that can be accessed remotely and 
                    acted upon and updated independently.
