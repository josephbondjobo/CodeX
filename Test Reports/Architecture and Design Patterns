Architectures:
  Service Oriented- This architecture would work well for our project as our project fits within to the 
                    four properties of Service Oriented Architecture. 
                    Namely :It logically represents a business activity with a specified outcome.
                            It is self-contained.
                            It is a black box for its consumers.
                            It may consist of other underlying services.
                            
                    Based on these properties it is easy to see how the services for our project are provided to other 
                    components. A service is a discrete unit of functionality that can be accessed remotely and 
                    acted upon and updated independently.
                    
  
  Client Server- This architecure complements our project quite well as it is a network architecture where each computer or
                 process is either a client or a server. In our case our database will act as our server and the requests being 
                 made to the server will come from service requesters called clients. The server will share its resources with 
                 the clients.
