//Tim Report

So far during the holiday I have been involved in several meetings with the CodeX group, 
over google hangouts, slack and even skype.

I have made additions to the System Requirements Document, more specifically towards the constraints and design constraints. 
I have also proof read the document after the other members have made their additions and changes.

As a group we've also updated our progress and our plans for the next steps we need to take.

Since our last demo I have participatd in the team meetings on slack and skype. I also met up with some of the group 
memebers in person in order to help make changes to the documentation in regards to reformatting.
I made significant contributions to the System Requirements Document, with regards to the Overall Description of the project
and some use cases. Mainly worked on section 2 in the teams documentation and I also handled the complilation of the latex document for the group.
As a group we've began to integrate the progress made by different people and started planning how we will move forward with the project.
