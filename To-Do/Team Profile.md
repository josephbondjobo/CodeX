I am currently finishing off my BSc IT and Enteprises at the University of Pretoria. This has allowed me to 
develop not only my logic, analysis and programming skills but has also allowed me to strengthen my 
business management skills as well. I have done part time front end web development for a few different 
businesses as well as have competed in the discovery hackathon. I would consider some of my best traits as
