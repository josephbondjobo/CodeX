\section{Introduction}

	\subsection{Background} 
	Reroute Systems is a software company with different in-house developed applications. The Purchase Management System application is the main application and is mainly active in the pharmaceutical space. The main functionality of this system is routing of requests for products from account holders to various wholesalers/suppliers, receiving the result of the order and routing the answer back to account holder.
	
	\subsection{Purpose} 	
	For an account holder to request a product, s/he must search for it against the database with all the product information. The challenge is that each wholesaler/supplier can name/describe the product in a different way/manner, and when the account holder performs the search against the master product list, the same product must be displayed across all wholesalers/suppliers, using the link between master product list and the different wholesaler's/supplier's product list.
	
	\subsection{Scope} 
	The core of the system is a search engine which is enriched with functionality
of performing some machine learning in order to retrieve the product in a master file found in a database running on the server through RESTful calls. The high level modules and their responsibilities are shown in the figure below. \\ \\

\section{Overall Description}

\subsection{Product Perspective}
        \subsubsection{System Interface}{
			\begin{enumerate} 
				\item User Interface:
					\begin{itemize}
				\item Functionality:\\
					The functionality of the user interface is to allow the user to interact with the system. Through this aspect of the system the user can perform all the functions necessary to use the smart search of the system. Through this, the user is able to specify the search criteria to be used by the system.\\
				\item How functionality achieves requirements:\\	
					The user interface allows the functionality of the application to meet the requirements. The user is able to search for any product based on any value they enter in, such as the product name or product ID. The user is able to view displayed information of products, that is based closely on keywords and values or any thing resembling the name. \\
					\end{itemize}
					
				\item Hardware Interface:
					\begin{itemize}
					\item Functionality:\\
					The functionality of this system interface is the physical hardware that allows software operation. The hardware in this case is specifically the desktop which allows the user to run the system.\\
				\item How functionality achieves requirements:\\
					This hardware will allow the achievement of the requirements by facilitating the operation of the application. The networking hardware of the components such as the Wireless Fidelity infrastructure or LAN connections between the devices which will allow for communication to the system server.
				\end{itemize}
				
				\item Software Interface:
					\begin{itemize}
					\item Functionality:\\
						The functionality of the software interface is to facilitate the communication between the hardware infrastructure of the device(s) running the application's front-end and the Reroute Server. An example of this would be the operating system of the device in use. The operating system would allow the application to make use of the networking infrastructure and communicate the necessary information to the application via RESTful calls. This would enable the device to communicate with the server and perform the necessary requests.\\

					\item How functionality achieves requirements :\\
This would allow the achievement of the requirements, as the communication of the application to the system server is vital to the operation of the Smart Search. By allowing communication over WI-Fi, the user is able to communicate to the server from any location  or just stick to older and more familar devices such as computers, fulfilling the requirement.
					\end{itemize}
			\end{enumerate} 
}

		
            \subsubsection{User Interface}
	    All users will be able use the Smart Search system from their desktop devices when the application is launched.
For the account user interface, the registered users will be able to login to their account, using their account information.
\\\\
	    \subsubsection{Communications Interface}
	 \begin{itemize}
	    \item Users using the web will use HTTP/HTTPS protocol.
	    \item RESTful calls from the differrent platform to the server API.
	    \item Cloud-based server running the database.
	    \end{itemize}
	    
            \subsubsection{Memory}
	    {The desktop application will use a minimum amount of space of roughly 300MB.\\
		Primary memory(RAM) will use 50MB on average, based on how long the application is being used.}
		
            \subsubsection{Operations}

            	{The user will require a series of usual and special case operations to be fulfilled by the system. The user will use the system in normal case operations that comprise of searching on any of the different properties of a product. On a usual case, the user will search for a product based on the name of the product of interest.\\\\
            	The system will provide a user the option to either save their data, such as variations of product names, locally on the device or remotely on the server.}
		
           \subsubsection{Sit Adaption Requirements}
        (to be completed)

		\subsection{Product Functions} {The main function of the Smart Search will be to retrieve product information based on the values given to the system. The basic functions will include:  }
	\begin{itemize}
  		\item A search based on a specific property of a product such as the name or ID.
	\end{itemize}
	
    	\subsection{User Characteristics}  

{The general user will use the system to retrieve product information. They will require minimal skills in order to utilise the application, including the ability to connect to the Wi-Fi and use it. They will require background knowledge/education in the medical or pharmaceutical field to use the application.\\}

    	\subsection{Constraints}
	The system will
	\begin{itemize}
		\item only use the data contained in the client's existing database.

	The system is subjected to working with an Internet Connection due to the linkage with the cloud. Without this in place, the system will not function.	
		
	\end{itemize}
	
    	\subsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}
	Users will	
	\begin{itemize}
	 
		\item have some form of pharmaceutical knowledge.
		\item have basic computer skills.
		\item be connected to an internet connection.
	\end{itemize}

	The database will be updated regularly.

	\newpage
	
	\section{Specific Requirements}
This section gives a detailed description of the system requirements. It describes all the functional as well as the quality requirements of the system.

	\subsection{External Interface Requirements}

            \subsubsection{Software Interfaces}
The smart search application being build will be designed to run on Desktop running Windows OS.

	\subsection{Requirements}
	\subsubsection{Functional Requirements} 
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Fuzzy Search:\\\\
			This program must be able to locate and return products that are related to the searched term. It should be able to return the same product if various ways of writing the name is used.\\\\
	
		\item Fast Run-time:\\\\
			Because there are very large amounts of data to be searched, it is vital for the program to be very efficient.  Even though this could be a non-functional requirement, it is vital for this program to be as fast and efficient as possible.\\\\
			
		\item Machine Learning:\\\\
			The ability to learn from a user's previous interaction and adapt to it will improve the system’s capability and ability greatly. This can be done by using the dictionary provided by the ZIZO database, for creating new links between products that appear seemingly unrelated.\\\\
	
		\item Handle Concurrent Users:\\\\
			This program will be used by many people, in many different fields simultaneously. It is therefore very important for it to be able to handle multiple users at the same time. This will be achieved by the Cloud based architecture.\\\\
	
		\item Scalability:\\\\
			Since it is essential for this system to be efficient with large datasets as well as small datasets, scalability will be an essential functional requirement. The system’s ability to stay efficient with very large sets of data is an essential part to the system.
		 \end{itemize}

	\subsubsection{Non-Functional Requirements}
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Predictive Typing:\\\\
			Predictive typing is when the program suggests a possible solution as the user is typing. This is often based on previous searches and most common searches. This will help improve the user experience. \\\\
		
		\item Spell checker:\\\\
			The program will check the spelling as the user is typing a product name to enhance the search. \\\\
	
		\item Roubstness:\\\\
			The system will not be easily breakable as it will be error proof to a feasible extent, to avoid unnecessary fault and not wholly be affected by the hardware failures. The system should be able to recover quickly from such failures, or at least be able to hold up or return to a valid stage/state.
			
			
		\item Reliability:\\\\
			This product should be able to adapt to different users in various fields as well as to different habits, interfaces, environments and needs of users.  
	
		\item Storing and using search history:\\\\
			Being able to store the search history will increase the user experience, help with predictive typing and improve the program's ability to learn and adapt.\\\\
		\end{itemize}

				\end{tabular}
				\end{center}
				\item Logout
			\end{itemize} 
		\item \textbf{Important} 
		\begin{itemize}
                \item The application must search for the item the user enters for their desired search. 
                \item The system must return all possible matches to whatever the user searches.
		\item The system must perform a smart search.
		\item The application must be fast.
                \end{itemize}
		
		\item \textbf{Nice to have}
		\begin{itemize}
		\item System using a search history, predictive typing. 
		\item A mobile version of the system such as Android.
		\end{itemize}
		\end{enumerate} 
	\subsection{Performance Requirements}
	The performance requirements of the smart search app. can be sub-divided into two components, of which are the following:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Client Application:\\\\

		\begin{itemize}
		\item The software needs to be responsive and lightweight enough to run well on desktop.\\
		\item During User search, the Smart Search system will need to perform in real time showing results as necessary.\\
		\item The data usage should be kept to a minimum as to not overload the whole system's Wi-Fi infrastructure being used for non-searching purposes.\\
		\end{itemize}

	\item Server Performance Requirements:\\\\

		\begin{itemize}
		\item The system should be able to handle multiple users using the smart search.\\
		\item The system has to be able run at a high speed, returning the results of a search immediately.\\
		\item The system should be able to handle a capacity of requests made to the database to make efficient searches and matches. \\
		\item The system should be able to return matches of a high probability of available data in the database on the cloud.\\
		\item The system will need to be able to concurrently handle smart searches across the board.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}

	\subsection{Design Constraints}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item to be completed
	\end{itemize}

	\subsection{Software System Attributes}
	The software system will have the following attributes:
		
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Availability: The system and its functions will be available to any registered user as long as there is an internet connection. 
\\\\
		\item Reliability: The system will provide results that are available on the database to match whenever a user performs a search/smart search.
\\\\
		\item Portability: The system will be able to function across a multiple interfaces. Therefore, it will be able to port to Android and iOS with ease at a later time. 
\\\\
		\item Maintainability: The application will be able to be extended easily with new functionality. There will also be a good test environment to reduce and make it easy to find system errors.  
\\\\
		\item Robustness: The system will be able to stand against errors made by users in the search, returning no results and error messages as a result.
		\end{itemize}
        
	\subsection{Other Requirements}

\subsubsection{Quality requirements}
The web interface should be accessible to most modern PCs with a modern browser.
The RESTful API will be implemented using the HTTP protocol as a high-level protocol. HTTP was the choice because it is a widely spread and deployed protocol, allowing a lot of flexibility.
