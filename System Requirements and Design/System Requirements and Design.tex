\section{Introduction}

	\subsection{Background} 
	Reroute Systems is a software company with different in-house developed applications. The Purchase Management System application is the main application and mainly active in the 		pharmaceutical space. The main functionality of the system is routing of request for products from account holders to the various wholesalers / suppliers, receiving the result of the order and route answer back to account holder.
	
	\subsection{Purpose} 	
	For the account holder to request a product he/she must search for it against the database with all the product information, the challenge is that each wholesalers / suppliers can name/describe the product differently and when the account holder do the search against the master product list the same product must be displayed across all wholesalers / suppliers using the link between master product list and the different wholesalers / suppliers product list (the user compare the prices of same product across the wholesalers / suppliers before making a decision)
	\subsection{Scope} 
	The core of the system is a search engine which is enriched with functionality
of performing some machine learning in order to retrieve the product in a master file found in a Databased running on the server through http calls. The high level modules and their responsibilities are shown in the figure below. \\ \\

\section{Overall Description}

\subsection{Product Perspective}
        \subsubsection{System Interface}{
			\begin{enumerate} 
				\item User Interface:
					\begin{itemize}
				\item Functionality:\\
					The functionality of the user interface is to allow the user to interact with the system. Through this aspect of the system the user can perform all the functions necessary to use the smart search of the system. Through this the user is able to specify the search criteria to be used by the system.\\
				\item How functionality achieves requirements:\\	
					The user interface allows the functionality of the application to meet the requirements. The user is able to search for any product based on any value they enter int. The user is able to be displayed information of products, that closely based on keywords and values or any thing resembling the name. \\
					\end{itemize}
				\item Hardware Interface:
					\begin{itemize}
					\item Functionality:\\
					The functionality of this system interface is the physical hardware that allows software operation. The hardware in this case is specifically the mobile devices on which the apps run and the computers the websites usually accessed through.\\
				\item How functionality achieves requirements :\\
					This hardware will allow the achievement of the requirements by facilitating the operation of the application. The user will be able to press the physical device screen in order to use the search capabilities and other features of the application. The networking hardware of the components such as the wireless fidelity infrastructure or LAN connections within the devices which will allow for communication to the system server.
				\end{itemize}
				\item Software Interface:
					\begin{itemize}
					\item Functionality:\\
						The functionality of the software interface is to facilitate the communication between the hardware infrastructure of the devices running the application front-end and Reroute Server. An example of this would be the operating system of the device in use. The operating system would allow the application to make use of the networking infrastructure and communicate the necessary information to the application via RESTful calls. This would enable the device to communicate with the server and perform the necessary requests.
\\
					\item How functionality achieves requirements :\\
This would allow the achievement of the requirements as the communication of the application to the system server is vital to the operation of the Smart Search. By allowing communication over WI-Fi the user is able to comunicate to the server from any location  or just stick to older and more familar devices such as computers, fulfilling the requirement .
					\end{itemize}
			\end{enumerate} 
}

		
            \subsubsection{User Interface}
	    {All users will be able use to the Smart Search system from their device when the application is launched.
For the account user interface, the registered userswill be able to login to their account, using their account information.
\\\\
}

\subsubsection{Hardware Interface}
		{
The actual Wi-Fi interface between the mobile device / computer and Wi-Fi will be abstracted by the phone and will be managed by the actual underlying operating system on the phone. On a computer the LAN interface may also be abstracted by the computer and will be managed by the actual underlying operating system on the computer if a wired connection is to be used.}
            \subsubsection{Software Interface}
            to be completed

	    \subsubsection{Communications Interface}
	 \begin{itemize}
	    \item Users using the web will use HTTP/HTTPS protocol.
	    \item REST calls from the differrent platform to the server API.
	    \item Cloud-based server running the database
	    \end{itemize}
            \subsubsection{Memory}
	    {The desktop application will use a minimum amount of space of roughly 300MB.  the size could dramtically increase due to caching and storage of tof data locally. The size will depend solely on caching of a lot of data. \\
Primary memory(RAM) will use 50MB on average, based on how long the application is being used.}
            \subsubsection{Operations}

            	{The user will require a series of usual and special case operations to be fulfilled by the system. The user will use the system in normal case operations that comprise of searching on any of the different properties of a product. On a usual case the user will search for a product based on the name of the product of interest .\\\\
            	The system will provide a user the option to either save there data, such as variations of product names, locally on the device or remotely on the server.}
           \subsubsection{Sit Adaption Requirements}
        to be completed
		\subsection{Product Functions} {The main function of the Smart Search will be to retrieve product iformation based on the values given to the user. The basic functions will include:  }
	\begin{itemize}
  		\item A search based on a specific property of a product such as the name
	\end{itemize}
    	\subsection{User Characteristics}  
		{ 
	
{The general user will use the system to retrive product information. They will need minimal skill in order to utilise the application, including the ability to connect to the Wi-Fi and use . The general user will have restricted usage of the in-app game and certain privileges that require a user profile. They will not require any additional expertise or education to function the application.\\}

	\section{Specific Requirements}
This section gives a detailed description of the system requirements. It describes all the functional as well as the quality requirements of the system.

	\subsection{External Interface Requirements}

                 \subsubsection{Software Interfaces}
The application will run on the Android operating system, specifically version 4.0. and upwards. It will also run on iOS operating system version 7.3 and above.

	\subsection{Requirements}
	\subsubsection{Functional Requirements} 
	1.	Fuzzy Search:\\\\
	This program must be able to locate and return products that are related to the searched term. It should be able to return the 	same product if various ways of writing the name is used.\\\\
	
	2.	Fast Run-time:\\\\
	Because there are very large amount of data to be searched, it is vital for our program to be very efficient.  Even though this could be a non-functional requirement, it is vital for this program to be as fast and efficient as possible.\\\\
	
	3.	Handle Concurrent Users:\\\\
	This program will be used by many people, in many different fields simultaneously. It is therefore very important for it to be able to handle multiple users at the same time.\\\\
	
	4.	Machine Learning:\\\\
	In order for this program to run efficiently it must be able to adapt to the needs and habits of its users. It should be able to learn search patterns and learn from previous searches.\\\\
	\subsubsection{Non-Functional Requirements}
	1.	Predictive Typing:\\\\
	Predictive typing is when the program suggests a possible solution as the user is typing. This is often based on previous searches and most common searches. This will help improve the user experience. \\\\

	2.	Return Generic Medicine:\\\\
	In some cases it will be handy if the program suggested the different generic medicine for the medicine you searched for. This could help users find the product they need even if they are unsure of the name.
	
	3.	Robustness:\\\\
	This product should be able to adapt to different users in various fields as well as to different habits, interfaces, environments and needs of users.  
	
	4.	Storing and using search history: 
	Being able to store the search history will increase the user experience, help with predictive typing and improve the programs ability to learn and adapt.
